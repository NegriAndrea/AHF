****                              CHANGELOG                              ****

29/04/2005      - fixed minor bugs in ascii2amiga.c
                - added ARTascii2amiga.c for easier use of Anatoly Klypin's IC generator
                - added capability to read P-GADGET data (i.e. multiple GADGET files)
                - added amigaXi to analysis/

                  based upon particle content
                - changed amiga2ascii.c, ascii2amiga.c, lcone2ascii.c and galaxy2amiga.c:
                  ASCII files now contain particles masses in Msun/h (makes more sense...)
                - added amiga2asciiSample.c to convert/
                - fixed trouble with no_vpart in ascii2amiga.c

                - fixed a minor bug in amigaPk.c
                - fixed some *very* minor memory leaks (of order 500 bytes....)

24/05/2005      - fixed the final *very, very* minor memory leak

25/05/2005      - fix that bug at the very end of main.c that lead to bus error right before end
                - found a bug in analysis/IDL/plot_massfunc.pro

26/05/2005      - fixed a bug in amigaPdens.c that might cause the programm to hang

07/06/2005      - added LCDM.064 to Sample/ (not as good as the 128^3 test run, but also not as bad as the 16^3 one...)

08/06/2005      - separated Sample/ from the rest of the package to save download times

09/06/2005      - some fiddling with conversion/analysis routines (nothing serious!)
                - added -DART: AMIGA can now read ART simulation output

14/06/2005      - name for dumpfile and logfile are not longer input by the user but rather constructed from outfile_prefix
                  -> adjust AMIGA.input files accordingly!!!

21/06/2005      - added eigenvectors to _halos output files (for -DBDM and -DAHF)
                  -> changes in all analysis/ routines that deal with _halos files
                - fixed a minor bug in ahf_halos.c giving too large R_vir for some satellites
                - added -DAHFfilament (ahf_filament.c)
                - added -DAHFzoomhalo (ahf_zoomhalo.c) -> not functioning yet though!

24/06/2005      - fiddled with -DMMFOCUS as there are still some unresolved subtleties :-(

27/06/2005      - completely removed the old -DMMFOCUS: it was just causing grief and headaches
                - implemented a new -DAHFmmfocus that just keeps the high-resolution particles right from the start (i.e. startrun.c)

12/07/2005      - added amiga2mlapm.c for sake of completeness
                - fixed minor bug in bdm_centres.c related to fabs(global.z) vs. global.z in filenames...

13/07/2005      - polishing changes made yesterday...

14/07/2005      - added halos2geom.c to convert/
                - properly added -DAHFgeom

27/07/2005      - there were colliding definitions of SKIP in input.c

28/07/2005      - do not normalize angular momentum vector in halo profile any longer
                - added profile of intertia tensor eigenvectors

29/07/2005      - fixed recently introduced bug in bdm_centres.c: line 282 -> change analyseRef(i) to analyseRef(0)
                - fixed bug related to profile of eigenvectors in bdm_halos.c 

02/08/2005      - tweaked memory handling for AHFstep and BDMstep
                - forgot to declare int_dummy in all sorts of files (important for -DLONG4)

03/08/2005      - adjusted routines in analysis/IDL/ to properly account for conversion to physical rather than comoving coordinates
                - added -DHUBBLE_VELDIS which accounts for Hubble flow in sigV calculation

05/08/2005      - there is still from time to time that annoying bug "count != numHalos" in connectRef()...made a quick and dirty fix
                - fiddled with HaloHistory.f and MergerTree.f
                - fine tuned halos2geom.c

09/08/2005      - added calculation of linear growth factor to cosmology.c

10/08/2005      - fiddled with HaloTracker.c, i.e. added read-routine for MLAPM etc.
                - removed that annoying warning related to ReadLong and its "long unsigned" argument

11/08/2005      - added _profiles to HaloTracker.c

12/08/2005      - added read_ART() to HaloTracker.c

15/08/2005      - fixed memory leak in read_ARTbinaries() (mostly affected HaloTracker.c)

19/08/2005      - added -DGADGET2 -> possibility to read in SnapFormat=2 GADGET files
                - if gas/stars are present in the GADGET file they will be read in, too
                  -> they are simply treated as DM particles with their appropriate mass, 
                     i.e. they will be gravitationally considered during remove_unbound() etc. and make it into the AHF output files
                - halo particles have now internally the weight 1 and hence
                  -> "npart=nvpart" in .AHF_halos means that this object contains only halo particles...
                     (remember: npart  = Ndm+Nstar+Ngas+...
                                nvpart = Mdm+Mstar+Mgas+... with Mx in internal units, i.e. Ndm=Mdm as halo particles have the weight 1!)
                - introduced new mapping of GADGET ID's to AMIGA ID's
                  -> halo particles will *always* run from 0 -> nall[1]-1 in AMIGA 
                  -> gas/stars ID's are meaningless across different time steps
                - NOTE: if you are using AHF on a GADGET output file with gas/stars, please make sure that you...
                        a) turn off AHFmmfocus
                        b) set AHF_MASSMIX to 0.0
                        (AHFmmfocus only uses the lowest mass particles, and
                         AHF_MASSMIX rejects halos with a certain mixture of different particle species)
                - NOTE: there is currently no way to tell how many gas/star particles are in a halo,
                        halos are just "mass clumps" made up of dm, gas, stars, etc. so far...
                        but as explained above: one can sort of estimate the fraction of mass in stars/gas

22/08/2005      - fixed a couple of bugs in the 19/08/2005 version
                - added -DGADGET_IGNORE_IDS: the gadget ID's are NOT used at all and simply ignored
                  -> if halo particles ID's are not consecutive there is no way of constructing merger trees
                     and hence my mapping onto AMIGA ID's will fail....switch this on to give up ID's at all...
                - added -DGADGET_GAS_ONLY and -DGADGET_STARS_ONLY
                  -> the name says it all...

24/08/2005      - added -DGADGET_IDS
                  -> just drag GADGET ID's through to *_particles file without further thinking about them

25/08/2005      - fixed bug related to Hubble flow
                  -> used H0*r instead of H(z)*r when removing unbound particles

20/09/2005      - added -DAHF2 to AMIGA
                  -> satellite particles are given back to the host once they have been used, i.e.
                     particles can belong to more than just one halo again!

21/09/2005      - cleaned up a few bits and pieces and debugged -DAHF2, respectively

27/09/2005      - fixed some bugs related to GADGET in HaloTracker.c

28/09/2005      - replaced MAXSTRING for AMIGA's io_header in param.h with HEADERSTRING (and all other relevant files!)

21/10/2005      - added -DMANUAL_DVIR which abuses io.out_dumps in calc_virial()....for locating unbound superclusters or whatever ;-)

02/11/2005      - added -DASCII
                  -> AMIGA can now read ASCII files as input
                    (AMIGA expects Mpc/h, km/sec and Msun/h, but check read_ascii() in input.c for more details about the exact format)
                - fixed minor bug in input.c related to ART_SKIP

08/11/2005      - fixed minor bug in HaloTracker.c in read_mlapm()

07/12/2005      - started to code -DAHT
                - some modifications to amigaExtractHalos.c allowing to read in -DPARTLEVEL data

08/12/2005      - added -DPOWERSPECTRUM
                  -> whenever an output file is written, AMIGA also dumps a *_Pk file
                     containing P(k) derived using the domain grid
                  -> AMIGA also monitors the growth rate of the fundamental mode (PKMODE=1 in param.h)
                     comparing it to the linear growth rate
                     -> whenever P/D >> 1 your fundamental mode turned non-linear (and AMIGA terminates)!
                - added -DOUTDUMPS
                  -> write output files with the same frequency as dumpfiles
                - added -DHAFmaxhalo
                  -> the simulation stops once the most massive halo is heavier than AHF_MAXHALO in param.h

                  => all these features were added to ease the simulation of scale-free P(k) models

09/12/2005     - also consider gas particle temperature when removing unbound particles (only applicable when reading GADGET data!)

13/12/2005     - fixed some things in HaloTracker.c (e.g. usage of Hubble instead of H0, etc.)

20/12/2005     - amigaExtractHalos.c can now read MLAPM, GADGET, ART, ...

19/01/2006     *********BUGFIX*********
(BUILD 33)       -> ahf_gridinfo.c: wrong calculation of AHF_MINREF and global.ahf_nogrids when using startAHFgrid!
               - some more tinee winee changes here and there

26/01/2006     - fixed bug in ahf_gridinfo.c
(BULIT 34)       -> refine_dens was calculated wrongly

30/01/2006     - added -DPDENS ("make AMIGApdens")
(BUILD 35)       -> calculate density at particle positions using full AMR hierarchy... 
                    (amigaPdens.c only uses a fixed cubical grid!)

31/01/2006     - fixed some bugs related to -DLGADGET and finally understood the GADGET(2) file format ;-)
(BUILD 36)

01/02/2006     - -DPDENS can now also write GADGET's IDs if required (compile with -DGADGET_IDS)
(BUILD 36)

03/02/2006     - fixed recently introduced bug related to -DPMASS_FROM_FILE
(BUILD 37)

06/02/2006     - Stu added -DAHFisodensity: no cutting of halos at virial radius,
(BUILD 38)       but rather keeping all particles on isodensity contours
                 (-DAHFnoremunbound won't even remove the unbound particles...)

09/02/2006     - bug fix in lltools.c: "edge_shift" was calculated wrongly
(BUILD 39)       -> only affected particles moving farther than 2 grid cells (and "leavers")
               - fiddling with fprintf(io.logout) when using AGFstep
               - started re-coding of cells centres (nothing to worry about yet...)

12/02/2006     - added read_amiga_header() to utility.c allowing for a more convenient handling of AMIGA's header
(BUILD 40)

27/02/2006     - more flexible reading of input files (sizeof(long) is written to file, etc.)
(BUILD 41)       -> severe impact upon older AMIGA binaries; they are no longer compatible!

28/02/2006     - completely re-wrote trunc_err() for OCTPLIT plus all the necessary changes in fine_to_coarse.c and coarse_to_fine.c
(BULIT 42)

01/03/2006     - renamed all "force.fc_dens", "force.residual", etc. stuff back to "force.temp[0]", "force.temp[1]", etc.
(BUILD 43)       -> this gives an easier overview of which routines modifies what force.temp[] storage...
               - fixed a bug that caused most of the trouble with OCTSPLIT: fc_sep[] in all c2f and f2c routines was calculated wrongly!
               - fixed a bug related to read_ARTbinaries()

08/03/2006     - fixed memory leak in relink.c related to OCTSPLIT
(BUILD 44)       (careful: relink.c only works if there are less than 1000 particles at a node!)
               - added -DOLD_AMIGA_FORMAT to be more compatible

09/03/2006     - rehashed relink.c for OCTSPLIT: removed that "1000 particles" restriction....
(BUILD 45)     - renamed -DOLD_AMIGA_FORMAT to AMIGA_ONE_FORMAT

09/03/2006     - bug fix in read_gadget(): global.gadget_mmin was determined wrongly, if reading individual particles masses from file
(BUILD 46)     - added -DGADGET_SHIFT
                 -> (try to) shift (0,0,0) into centre of box

10/03/2006     - added proper calculation of simu.min_weight into input.c that does not rely on -DNO_SPECIES
(BUILD 47)     - bug fix in ahf_halos.c related to global.domgrid_no when free'ing the grids
               - tweaked ATS in main.c

16/03/2006     - OCTSPLIT does not require an x-sorted linked-list as there are no calls to inc_to_a_x() etc.
(BUILD 48)       -> -DLL_NOXSORT switches off the sorting of the "cur_node->ll" linked lists!
               - added c2f_dens() to coarse_to_fine.c that ensures "c2f*f2c=1"
                 -> routine never used, but handy to have...

23/03/2006     - Steffen fixed some minor issues in ahf_gridinfo.c related to those annoying "qsort compilation messages"
(BUILD 49)

24/03/2006     - added -DGADGET_PARTICLES_INFO, i.e. the .AHF_particles file is written in a new format that contains information about the species type...
(BUILD 50)

28/03/2006     - fixed some bugs in -DGADGET_PARTICLES_INFO

03/04/2006     - fixed memory leak in AHF
(BUILD 51)       -> however, there are still some leaks to be tracked down!

07/04/2006     - added -DBDMudc = BDMstep with User-Defined-Centres (udc)
(BUILD 52)       -> bdm_halos() looks for a *.BDMudc_centres files rather than using the one generated by bdm_centres()

20/04/2006     - added "density and potential at particle position" to -DFORCETEST
(BUILD 53)     - tweaked utility.c related to machine_sizeof_long!=file_sizeof_long

30/05/2006     - major change in ahf_halos.c:
(BUILD 54)       -> the halo centres (i.e. centreDens.x/y/z) was calculated WRONGLY!!!!!
                 -> it was *not* the density weighted centre of an isolated refinement but rather the coordinate of the node with the highest density
                 => this has been put into the switch -DAHFmaxdenscentre while no switch now chooses the new density weighted centre scheme!!!

02/06/2006     - added -DAHFpotcentre
(BUILD 55)       -> use potential rather than density to derive the halo centre

21/06/2006     - fixed some issues with -DHAPPI
(BUILD 56)

26/06/206      - fixed an issue with -DGADGET
(BUILD 57)       -> in case the particle mass is very small (e.g. below ZERO!), the usage of massarr[] did not function properly

05/07/2006     - major changes for -DOCTSPLIT
(BUILD 58)       -> refine_gridOCTSPLIT.c contains all grid refinement routines related to OCTSPLIT feature
                 -> refine_grid.c does *not* contain any OCTSPLIT stuff anymore
                 -> step.c has a better handling of filenames for FORCETEST
                 -> coarse_to_fine.c contains a NEW_C2F_POT feature allowing for more flexibility when prolonging the potential

10/07/2006     - more -DOCTSPLIT changes!
(BUILD 59)       -> completely rehashed coarse_to_fine.c and fine_to_coarse.c for OCTSPLIT
                    get_c2fslope() determines the slope used for interpolating from coarse_to_fine!
                    (cf. C2F_MIDCENTRE_NODELIMITER, C2F_MIDCENTRE, C2F_REDUCED, ...)
               - minor other changes
                 -> write_potential.c: added some debugging info for OCTSPLIT
                 -> re-formatted gs.c
                 -> mg_control.c: debugging info for OCTSPLIT 

12/07/2006     - fine tuning of OCTSPLIT
(BUILD 60)       -> moved get_c2fslope() to utility.c
                 -> get_c2fslope() is now also used with fc_overlap()

13/07/2006     - removed "#ifdef OCTSPLIT" around "mg = assin_dens()" in gen_refgrid()
(BUILD 61)     - the OCTSPLIT version did not correct for a drift in pot_mean so far!
                 -> layzer_irvine.c and fine_to_coarse.c have been modified accordingly...
               - added C2F_DSTAR_SLOPE which simply relies on get_DSTARnodes() to obtain the c2f_slope...

14/07/2006     - fixed an OCTSPLIT bug in force_interp.c
(BUILD 62)        -> still not update dand moved to the new Taylor expansion scheme...
               - added C2F_DSTAR_SLOPE which should be faster when obtaining the Taylor expansion terms

17/07/2006     - adjusted a couple of more unresolved issues with OCTSPLIT
(BUILD 63)       -> the whole truncation error calculation was faulty...
                 -> added -DF2C_POT which restrict fin_node potential to coa_node during trunc_err()
                    (this is more time consuming when calculating the truncation error but may speed up the next iteration on the coa_grid!?)
                    -> CAREFUL: this feature does not function at the moment and is considered lowest priority to fix!

17/07/2006     - started the HYDRO part...
(BUILD 64)       -> revived that -DGAS feature
                 -> renamed solve_poisson.c to solve_gravity.c
                 -> renamed solve_domgrid() to  solve_dom_gravity()
                 -> renamed solve_refgrid() to  solve_ref_gravity()

24/07/2006     - -DSUPERCOMOVING: introduced supercomoving variables
(BUILD 65)       -> the input/output files are not affected though!
               - removed -DISOLATED2

27/07/2006     - renamed densB, momB, energyB to gas_dens, gas_mom, gas_Energy
(BUILD 66)     - added MULTIMASS consistency check to read_amiga_heaer()
               - the time unit for -DSUPERCOMOVING is now again "1/H0" rather than "1/H0 (2/sqrt(Omega0))"

03/08/2006     - name changes etc. (e.g. get_HAPPInodes() -> get_DISTnodesRAW()) as a preparation for the hydro solver
(BUILD 67)       -> coded two new get_DISTnodes() routines:
                    1. get_DISTnodes() is a complete re-write of the old get_HAPPInodes() that properly treats close-to-boundary nodes
                       -> NOTE: there is only a PERIODIC version yet!
                    2. get_DISTnodesTSC() utilizes get_TSCnodes() to obtain the DISTnodes, but is waaaaaaay too slow!
                    3. get_DISTnodesRAW() is just the old get_HAPPInodes()
               - added r_pquad() to alloc_struct.c (maybe it will be needed?!)
               - fiddled a bit with solve_hydro.c
               - added -DTWILIGHT_ZONE
                 -> create_twilight_zone(cur_grid) creates that twilight zone of ghost cells
                 -> TWLTBUF in param.h sets the number of ghost nodes surrounding a given grid
                 -> there are changes in all sorts of routines dealing with grid-loops, e.g. twlt_buf should take care of the twilight zone extend...
                 -> it should not harm to adapt >>all<< grid routines to take note of TWLTBUF, but that has not been done yet!
                 -> twilight zone is >>NOT<< created for the non-OCTSPLIT version!
                 IMPORTANT: -DTWILIGHT_ZONE is NOT functional yet! there is a serious problem with it...
                 NOTE: -DTWILIGHT_ZONE won't be needed for "KNP hydro solver" planned for implementation into AMIGA
               - added write_nodes.c for debugging purposes

08/08/2006     - name changes:
(BUILD 68)       -> -DGAS does not exist anymore
                 -> -DMLAPM_HYDRO refers to that part of -DGAS dealing with hydro-variables on MLAPM's grid structure
                 -> -DSTORE_REFS refers to that part of -DGAS dealing with the storage of old refinement grids
                    -> renamed gas.c to store_refs.c
                 -> -DHYDRO will become the hydro-solver
               - started coding Ziegler's KNP scheme for hydrodynamics

09/08/2006     - completely removed -DMLAPM_HYDRO: it's never ever gonna happen!
(BUILD 69)     - hydrodynamic variables are stored in a vector node->u[NHYDRO] rather than in node->gas_dens, etc.!
                 -> easier handling of equations plus greater flexibility when adding MHD variables!
               - bug fix in flux_x/y/z(): they should not only be evaluated at cur_node!

10/08/2006     - fixed some -DLIGHTCONE issues and made it work again!
(BUILD 70)     - completely re-wrote hydro.c!!!!
               - added hydro_tests.c
               - a lot of hydro-stuff fiddling and bug fixing!!!

(BUILD 71)     - advect Entropy rather than internal energy
               - -DHYDRO_TEST=0,1,2

12/08/2006     - the hydro test are now initiated as follows:
(BUILD 72)       -DHYDRO_TEST=0      shock tube along x-axis
                 -DHYDRO_TEST=1      shock tube along y-axis
                 -DHYDRO_TEST=2      shock tube along z-axis
                 -DHYDRO_TEST=3      spherical blast wave

16/08/2006     - some cosmetic changes...
(BUILD 73)

23/08/2006     - implementation of libio/
(BUILD 74)     - added some fflush(io.logfile) to ahf_halos.c
               - added -DHYDRO_DUNSPLIT to solve_hydro.c
               - added -DHYDRO_RUNGE_KUTTA

(BUILD 78)     - separated calculation of sig_v (incl. gas pressure) and Ekin

11/09/2006     - BUG FIX: the calculation of the density weighted halo centre in ahf_halos.c did not account for periodic boundaries!
(BUILD 79)     - .AHF_profiles contains the proper (physical) angular momentum now
               - added lambdaE to .AHF_halos
               - increased the default AHF_MINNODES value

                 "only update halo centre if we trust the finer centre..."
                 => this does NOT solve the problem though which still is apparent in AHF :-(

15/09/2006     - change in connectRef(): the "if(i==0)" statement was inside a "for(j)" loop! obtained substantial speed-up by taking it out of that loop... 
(BUILD 80)     - added -DPARDAU_DISTANCE, -DPARDAU_NODES, and -DPARDAU_PARTS:
                 PARDAU_DISTANCE is the old version which follows a host based upon closeRefDist
                 PARDAU_NODES follows a host by assuming the sub-grid with the most nodes is the host on the next finer level
                 PARDAU_PARTS follows a host by assuming the sub-grid with the most particles is the host on the next finer level

18/09/2006     - merged HaloProperties() with HaloProfiles() to speed up AHF
(BUILD 81)     - wrote get_r2() and get_RmaxVmax()
               - fixed memory leak: XYZ *pointer in ConstructHalos() was not free'd properly
               - renamed ReturnParticles() to SafeReturnParticles() and coded a new ReturnParticles() that does not store the id's for *.AHF_particles
                 -> there are odd situations where it is better to remove a halo completely from the list and rather give it back to its host...

21/09/2006     - there is still that odd bug with "numHalos != count" that has not been fixed yet!
(BUILD 82)       => I simply add +100 when allocating halos[] to circumvent segmentation faults...

22/09/2006     - modified calculation of lambdaE in HaloTracker.c using lots of tmp's

               - fixed some bugs in input.c (related to -DART and handling of nspecies) and main.c (missing declarations...)
               - define.h wrongly dealt with HYDRO_TEST<4
               - Cosmology.DAT is no called io.outfile_prefix+'.cosmology'
               - added some notes to move_part.c re:PERIODIC

               - decreased AHF_MINNODES again as too many low mass halos got lost

09/11/2006     - finally managed to get the hydro-Zeldovich test up and running
(BUILD 90)       -> this required some major tweaks regarding the supercomoving coordinates!

(BUILD 91)     - added DUAL_ENERGY_FORMALISM
               - fiddled a lot with the Zeldovich wave test (HYDRO_TEST==5)

13/11/2007     - removed all those calculations of two inertia tensors again
(BUILD 164)      -> either the reduced OR the standard one is being calculated!

16/11/2007     - new implementation of DUAL_ENERGY formalism
(BUILD 165)      -> calls to sync_ES() after every change to u[] or u_tmp[]!!!
               - renamed and moved subroutines around:
                 -> the hydro-equations are now located in hydro_equations.c
                 -> everything not directly related to the KNP scheme has been moved to hydro_util.c (e.g. calc_u_infc() etc.)

21/11/2007     - renamed sound_speed() to calc_cs()
(BUILD 166)    - moved min_max_speeds() to hydro_KNP.c as it is merely required by the KNP scheme

(BUILD 177)   - removed all that cal_grad_p() stuff
              - new DUAL_ENERGY treatment:
                edens is >>not<< advected but calculated (and stored in u[Uedens]) via DUAL_ENERGY (E- or S-System) and then used to obtain the pressure
                -> no need for calc_edens() anymore
                -> calc_p() simply relies on u[Uedens] now
              - completely new treatment for "gas particles"
                -> complete rehash of density.c as everything is now "hidden" in simu.f_b (=baryon fraction)

(BUILD 190)   - fine-tuned BlastWave test
              - fine-tuned CloudCollapse test

18/04/2008    - the movement of various routines accessing common variables to utility.c required some rehashing of header files!

20/05/2008    - substantial(!!) change in get_nnodes.c
(BUILD 197)     -> modified get_TSCnodes(), get_DSTARnodes(), and get_DISTnodes() to account for that "-1" bug in the quad-linked-list loop!
                -> or in other words: there was something wrong when comparing coordinates against the range of the quad, i.e. AMIGA was using ">" where it was supposed to check against ">="!

03/06/2008   - downloaded first changes by Timur regarding -DMHD
(BUILD 198)

03/06/2008   - removed get_TSCnodes() and get_DISTnodes() from calc_Flux()

(BUILD 204)  - OCTSPLIT changes:
               -> new f2c_source()
               -> new c2f_pot()

             - coded binning_parameter() in utility.c for convenience

05/08/2008   - bug fix related to binning_parameter()
(BUILD 208)    -> the routine needs to know what a HALO structure is...therefore removed the #ifdef AHF around all those AHF-related typedef's in tdef.h
             - downloaded all changes made by Steffen and Timur

07/08/2008   - added HYDRO_TEST==9
(BUILD 209)    -> shock tube in x-direction >>with<< magnetic field

21/08/2008   - introduced PERIODIC_X, PERIODIC_Y, and PERIODIC_Z instead of PERIODIC
(BUILD 211)    -> however, PERIODIC switches on periodicity in all three dimensions!

(BUILD 217)    -> everything after gather_hostParts() is now ready for OpenMP!
               -> everything after gather_hostParts() is NOT using halos[i].ll anymore but instead halos[i].ipart[]!
             - bug fixes in connectRef(): BUILD 216 was WRONG!!!

03/10/2008   - introduced -DWITH_OPENMP for ConstructHalos()
(BUILD 218)

08/10/2008   - fixed problems with Makefile's

09/10/2008   - removed PMASS_FROM_FILE
(BUILD 220)  - completely re-hashed the unit handling in AMIGA!
               -> every read_XXX() routine other than read_amiga() is expected to fill pos[] with Mpc/h, mom[] with km/sec, and weight with Msun/h
               -> there is then a call to ic_unit_conversion() that takes care of AMIGA internal units!

21/10/2008   - cleaning up some remnants
(BUILD 221)  - rehash of amigaPk.c
               -> uses libio_serial/ now
               -> reads in grid files

06/11/2008   - added possibility to restart a hydro-simulation
(BUILD 224)    -> works currently >>only<< for a regular domain grid
               -> added -DINIT_DMHYDRO as DEFINEFLAG for starting a hydro-simulation based upon DM particles only
             - fixed several bugs in libio_serial/
               -> sanity_check() had to be called at a different time for read_amiga()
               -> sanity_check() now also updates header_masses if needed...


07/11/2008   - analyseRef(): closeRefDist=(Dist/2)^2 rather than closeRefDist=alpha*Dist^2/2
(BUILD 225)  - changed AHF_MAX_GATHER_RAD to 2.0 Mpc/h instead of 1.5 Mpc/h
             - completely removed AHF_MINNODES
             - merged loops gather_hostPart() and ReturnParticles()

10/11/2008   - completely rehashed collectRef() and the way the spatialRef[][] centres are calculated
(BUILD 226)  - -DAHFcomcentre: added centre-of-mass centre of particles on spatialRef[][]
               -> all possible centres are being calculated simultaneously and then it is decided which one to use
             - gatherRad is now MAX(closeRefDist, gatherRad)
             - fixed bug in fc_overlap()
               -> we cannot interpolate coa_dens to fin_node as some coa_nodes do not carry any density all all yet...

12/11/2008   - rehashed gather_hostParts() and ReturnParticles()
(BUILD 227)  - bug fix in fine_to_coarse.c related to OPENMP (removed variables were still in the private list)

13/11/2008   - AHFcomcentre is switched on permamently in define.h now
(BUILD 228)  - no particle gathering in spatialRef2halos() anymore

14/11/2008   - bug fix in ahf_halos.c
(BUILD 229)    -> there was a SegFault problem with the halos[].ipart[] array

17/11/2008   - minor change in RefCentre()
(BUILD 230)    -> if all centreDens, centrePot, centreCMpart fail we fall back to centreGEOM (rather than centreDens!)
             - SUBSTANTIAL (conceptual!) change in rem_unbound()
               -> removed MEANV_ALL
               -> an unbound particle does not contribute to the bulk/mean velocity of the halo anymore in the unbinding procedure!

24/11/2008   - bug fix in input()
(BUILD 231)    -> read_gadget() part of input() was still accessing io.icfile_name which is undefined when compiling, for instance, amigaExtratHalos

26/11/2008   - bug fix in read_art()
(BUILD 232)    -> fclose() should not have been called in read_ARTbinaries
             - bug fixes in hydro.c
               -> "omp parallal" instead of "omp parallel"
             - replaced ReadString() with ReadChars()
               -> the terminating '\0' in ReadString is written to s[n], but s[] is only of length n!

27/11/2008   - added all hydro-parameters to get_user_data() for the case of -DART && -DHYDRO to be able to start hydro simulations using PMstartM.f
(BUILD 233)

01/12/2008   - further changes in the rem_unbound() related to the calculation of the bulk velocity
(BUILD 234)    -> if the innermost particle is unbound the whole halo will get disrupted as that first particle determines the bulk velocity!
             - proper calculation of spatialRef[][].volume

09/12/2008   - complete rehash of ReturnParticles() and gather_hostParts()
(BUILD 235)    -> we first move(!) all particles back to their respective host
               -> we then gather/copy them back
                  -> there were issues that gather_hostParts() did not gather all required particles...
               -> renamed a couple of routines along the way
               -> introduced prepare_particles() that encapsulates all these operations

11/12/2008   - some changes to the source code layout with respects to return_particls() and gather_hostParts()
(BUILD 236)

14/12/2008   - bug fix in read_gadget() in relation to multiple GADGET files
(BUILD 237)    -> the line "ipart += k*gadget.np[i][k];" was wrong and has been corrected to "ipart += gadget.np[i][k];"

14/01/2009   - tweaking the AHF performance
(BUILD 238)    -> the new AHF concept for gather_hostParts() led to a drop in performance by a factor of 5! NOT ACCEPTABLE!
             - so far, the only change is the usage of halos[].nll instead of halos[].npart in prepare_particles()

20/01/2009   - bug fix in ahf_halos.c
(BUILD 239)    -> ovdens in .AHF_profiles was wrong as it got modified by get_haloedge()!

22/01/2009   - minor changes in amigaPk.c and related in input_grid.c
(BUILD 240)    -> more modular handling of how to read a grid...
             - improvements in handling mass species with a spectrum exceeding several(!) orders of magnitude
             - fixed a conceptual bug in the determination of refine_ovdens
               -> we introduced a dependence on simu.pmass by simply using refine_mass = simu.pmass
               -> we now use simu.pmass*simu.max_weight to be on the safe side...
             - in case of GADGET simulation we will now always use GADGET_MUNIT as the mass unit...

03/03/2009   - added -DFORCETEST
(BUILD 241)

05/03/2009   - added read_deva()
(BUILD 242)    -> thermal energy not functional yet

05/03/2009   - merged with Kristin's latest changes
(BUILD 243)    -> completely rehashed HaloTracker.c that now utilizes all the routines in ahf_halos.c
             - fixed a minor bug related to -DFORCETEST in step.c

06/03/2009   - write more information into .AHF_particles for -DDEVA
(BUILD 244)    -> added itype and the actual DEVA ID
             - bug fix for cur_gas
               -> the check for a particle being a gas particle was not 100% correct!

08/03/2009   - introduced -DGAGDET_PMASS
(BUILD 245)    -> will use GADGET's particles mass unit in AMIGA, too
             - adjusted refine_mass in ahf_gridinfo.c:
               - introduced io.header.med_weight as well as simu.med_weight
               - refine_mass uses simu.med_weight*simu.pmass to determine the first grid to be used with AHF
               - med_weight can either be the weighted mean (not median as the name suggests!) of all particle masses in the simulation or the most_common_weight found in the data (the latter is the default!)
             - coded a couple more routines that may or may not turn out to the useful:
               - prune_host_halos() removes all particles outside MAX_GATHER_RAD from host halos
               - gather_parts_from_host() has been duplicated: a new version tries to avoid excessive realloc() calls (switched on via -DOPT_REALLOC)

12/03/2009     - added more compatibility for DEVA files, e.g. double precision, etc.
(BUILD 246)      -> the new -DDEVA2 flag allows to read the raw data (and automatically only keeps the hi-res region!)

16/03/2009     - added star particles to -DGAS_PARTICLES: the same properties as for gas particles are now also calculated for star particles!
(BUILD 247)      -> actually -DGAS_PARTICLES should better be renamed, but to not cause any confusion I simply keep the name for this feature

17/03/2009     - minor adjustement to read_mlapm() to be able to properly read that STH2 data
(BUILD 248)

17/03/2009     - bug fix in OPENMP version
(BUILD 249)      -> ConstructHalos() was missing a private declaration for halo structure

17/03/2009     - minor adjustement to read_deva() taking care of qhull file
(BUILD 250)      -> now defined in define.h (quick-and-dirty hack!)

18/03/2009     - amigaExtractHalos.c
(BUILD 251)      -> more flexibility for different *.AHF_particles formats by using fgets()
               - amigaPdens.c
                 -> possibility to shift particle positions into centre in case of periodic wrapping
               - PdensExtractHalos.c
                 -> automated shift of particles into centre as this code only produces visualisation output
               - substantial changes to read_deva() foer -DDEVA2
                 -> dropped the usage of the .qhull file and rather remove all tidal dark matter particles using a mass criterion
                 
06/04/2009     - name changes for various AHF features/DEFINEFLAGS (sorry not not keeping track of the actual changes)
(BUILD 252)      -> now complies with the definitions/descriptions in the AHF's users guide.

21/04/2009     - -DGAS_PARTICLES now also writes profile information to the number of gas and star particles into *.AHF_profiles
(BUILD 253)

22/04/2009     - changed gas and star information in *.AHF_profiles to nvpart_gas and nvpart_star instead of number of particles!
(BUILD 254)

05/05/2009     - minor bug fix in init_header_masses()
(BUILD 255)      -> drop mlimit usage and rather employ a "fractional difference criterion" to figure out new mass species
               - minor bug fix on sanity_check()
                 -> no longer dividing my pmass after call to init_header_masses() (only relevant for messed up AMIGA binary anyways!)
                 
07/05/2009     - unclear...changes by others
(BUILD 256)

08/05/2009     - changed DEVA_SKIP to use ReadUInt() instead of ReadInt()
(BUILD 257)    - updated changes done by Kristin and Steffen

08/05/2009     - first steps towards MPI version + stars
(BUILD 258)

08/05/2008     - serious bug fix for the stellar information when using GADGET files
(BUILD 259)      -> global.offset_stars was completely wrong!

11/05/2009     - A bunch of changes concerning NEWSTARTRUN (MPI):  A new
(BUILD 260)      gather_hostParts is added to improve speed in that part
                 of AHF.  That required adding a couple of helper
                 functions in libsfc and libutility.
               - FCSID has been removed.

12/05/2009     - The NEWSTARTRUN version now uses a different halo
(BUILD 261)      construction, utilizing the new gather_hostParts that
                 uses the SFC information to quickly gather particles.

12/05/2009     - Fixing a few minor issues with the MPI version
(BUILD 262)       concerning halo ignoring (that didn't work) and the
                 writing of the output file.
                 
03/06/2009     - improvements in reading of DEVA files
(BUILD 263)

10/06/2009     - added DEVA support to libio/
(BUILD 264)    - substantial change in calculation of halos[].gatherRad
                 -> we do not trust the halos[].hostHaloGrids anymore to be -1 for host halos only...
               - corrected unit error in usage of cur_gas->u and cur_part->u, respectively
                 -> the value is now scaled to AMIGA internal units when being used in ahf_halos.c
                 -> when reading from file it should be set to (km/sec)^2
               - renamed -DGADGET_PARTICLES_INFO to -DPARTICLES_INFO as this is a universal feature now!
               
12/06/2009     - some fine tuning of io_amiga.c in libio/ to properly assign f->minweight and f->maxweight
(BUILD 265)

12/06/2009     - Steffen made io_mgadget.c compatible with machines where sizeof(long)=4 (e.g. Apple's architecture)
(BUILD 266)

17/06/2009     - improved implementation of BYTESWAP status for io_deva.c
(BUILD 267)

19/06/2009     - initiated io_tipsy.c in libio/
(BUILD 268)      -> this would not have been possible without the great help of Justin Read!!! THANKS Justin!

20/06/2009     - fiddled with conversion factors for TIPSY
(BUILD 269)      -> v_fac in io_tipsy_scale_particles() was missing one additional "expansion"
                 -> e_fac in io_tipsy_read_particles_raw() was not set at all
                 
22/06/2009     - final polishing of TIPSY support
(BUILD 270)      -> the units are now supplied by the user via a file "tipsy.info"

24/06/2009     - serious bug fix in io_tipsy_header_def.h
(BUILD 271)      -> the memory allocated for the TIPSY header structure was only of size TIPSY_HEADER_SIZE
                    -> we forgot to allocate space for the extra information stored in the header structure that is >>not<< stored in the file :-(
                    
28/06/2009     - downloaded ASCII support for the MPI version coded by Steffen
(BUILD 272)

29/06/2009     - fixed a couple of problems with the naming of TIPSY_VUNIT and TIPSY_MUNIT across MPI and serial version
(BUILD 273)    - downloaded further updates for ASCII support in the MPI version

01/07/2009     - started adding support for the CUBEP3M code
(BUILD 274)

02/07/2009     - cleaning up of various #define's that did not work together anymore for the serial version
(BUILD 275)    - changed names for e.g. TIPSY_VUNIT, CUBEP3M_VUNIT, etc. in the respective header structures to small caps
               - CUBEP3M actually stores a^2 \dot{x} which has now been corrected for in io_cubep3m_scale_particles()
               - fixed a problem with f->minweight and f->maxweight for CUBEP3M support

03/07/2009     - calculation of most bound particle was missing the possible contribution from the thermal energy
(BUILD 276)

03/07/2009     - added v_esc2 calculation to both the *.AHF_halos and *.AHF_profiles files
(BUILD 277)      -> PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS COMPLETELY CHANGED THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE COLUMNS IN THESE TWO FILES!
               - change for the serial version in spatialref2halos() in ahf_halos.c
                 -> revived that if-statement "if ( halos[i].hostHaloGrids != -1 )" when determining the gatherRad!
               - moved back to using med_weight for the actual med_weight (instead of most_common_weight) in init_header_masses()
                 -> this version has been tested on all available test cases for both the serial and MPI version and appears to be working correctly!
               
13/07/2009     - preparing new output format for *.AHF_halos
(BUILD 278)      -> added coherent structures for DM, gas, and star properties only to HALO

14/07/2009     - added routine that deciphers the level of a (sub-)halo
(BUILD 279)      -> get_sublevel(haloID)

15/07/2009     - coherent structuring for *AHF_halos blocks
(BUILD 280)    - removed -DAHFabsangmom
               - removed -DAHFabsaxes
               - fixed a problem with periodic boundaries for Xcom_DM, Xcom_gas, Xcom_star, etc.

30/07/2009     - bug fix in io_tipsy.c
(BUILD 281)      -> the ID's for the gas particles were off by 1!! Stars and DM are unaffected though...

01/09/2009     - downloaded the latest changes made by Steffen regarding ahf_io.c from the server
(BUILD 282)

02/09/2009     - minor bug fix in ahf_io.c
(BUILD 283)      -> "AHFcenterfile" instead of "AHFcentrefile"

09/09/2009     - added -DTIPSY_ZOOMDATA
(BUILD 284)      -> shift[] in io_tipsy_scale_particles() will be ignored!
                 -> instead all particles are simply shifted by (+0.5, +0.5, +0.5)
                 
07/10/2009     - downloaded a bug-fix by Steffen
(BUILD 285)

13/10/2009     - -DAHFnoremunbound was missing in latest version that utilized the new ahf_io.c
(BUILD 286)    - -DNEWSTARTRUN now reads info from AHFstep.inout file as supposed!
               - ahf_io.c now prints again >>one<< (and not multiple!) header lines again
               
13/10/2009     - added -DAHFgridtreefile which dumps information about the centres of the grid tree
(BUILD 287)

14/10/2009     - added -DMARE_NOSTRUM_DM_ONLY and -DMARE_NOSTRUM_GAS_ONLY
(BUILD 288)      -> does NOT work when finding haloes, only works together with -DAHFgridtreefile!

11/11/2009     - fixed a bug that prevented all expect tasks the main one in an MPI run to write _halos files
(BUILD 289)

24/11/2009     - downloaded all the changes made by Steffen
(BUILD 290)      -> there is no -DWITH_AMIGA_input any longer!

25/11/2009     - minor change in io_tipsy.c and ahf_halos.c to improve user friendliness...
(BUILD 291)

07/12/2009     - bug fix in main.c
(BUILD 292)      -> global.no_part was not set when using -DNEWSTARTRUN

16/12/2009     - simply cleaning up a bit and making code and user's guide agree with each other :-)
(BUILD 293)

21/12/2009     - added -DAHFptfocus
(BUILD 294)      -> AHF now focuses the analysis only on a certain type of particles
                    (only works together with both MULTIMASS and GAS_PARTICLES!)
                    
08/01/2010     - initiated support for ART format
(BUILD 295)      -> reading of PMcrd.DAT (= ART header) functional

11/02/2010     - continued ART support
(BUILD 296)    - bug fix in allocation of memory for various file headers
                 -> now using sizeof(header_struct) instead of HEADER_SIZE
                 
22/02/2010     - minor modification to addition of Hubble drag during unbinding procedure
(BUILD 297)      -> can now be switched off by -DAHFnoHubbleDrag

25/02/2010     - Francisco Martinez added support for native DEVA format
(BUILD 298)      -> IO_FILE_DEVANATIVE 81

11/03/2010     - bug fix in ahf_halos_sfc_gatherParts()
(BUILD 299)      -> it could have happened that a halo obtained particles multiple times

12/03/2010     - only some cosmetic changes
(BUILD 300)

24/03/2010     - introduced safety switch in src/define.h preventing mixing of libio.a and libio_serial.a
(BUILD 301)

19/04/2010     - removed redundant code for -DAHFnoremunbound
(BUILD 302)      -> the call to rem_nothing() (instead of rem_unbound()) was not necessary!

03/05/2010     - added -DDVIR_200RHOCRIT
(BUILD 303)      -> uses 200*rho_crit as the criterion for the halo edge

27/05/2010     - fixed the usage of an uninitialzed variable in
(BUILD 304)      loadbalance.c (happened in a piece of code that is not
                 used in the vanilla version).

28/06/2010     - added full support for CubeP3M files
(BUILD 305)    - provided a defineflags to suppress creation of
                 _particles files
                 
29/06/2010     - resurrected some of the analysis/ tools (e.g. amigaSigmaR)
(BUILD 306)

14/09/2010      - bug fix in _io_art.c
(BUILD 307)

29/10/2010     - When using -DGAS_PARTICLES, the _profiles file will
(BUILD 308)      contain an extra column for the internal gas energy
                 within the radial shell (calculated as sum_i m_i * u_i,
                 where the sums extents over all gas particles in the
                 shell).
                 
22/12/2010     - minor bug fix in ahf_halos.c, there was an #ifdef GAS_PARTICLES missing
(BUILD 309)

12/01/2011     - bug fix in ahf_halos.c: If numHalos == 0 don't try to
(BUILD 310)      sort the halos according to mass (indexx doesn't seem
                 to handle an empty array?).
                 
14/01/2011     - bug fix in analyseRef()
(BUILD 311)      -> lost refinements were not correctly added to the most likely host leading to a segmentation fault

16/02/2011     - TIPSY support is a bit more verbose upon startup to figure out BYTESWAP issues etc.
(BUILD 312)    - preparations for SQL support

01/03/2011     - wrapped #ifdef AHF_SQL around ahf_io_sql.c
(BUILD 313)

02/03/2011     - bug fix: Phi0 was written out in the wrong unit
(BUILD 314)

07/03/2011     - resurrecting AMIGA'a MHD solver (unrelated to AHF!)
(BUILD 315)

17/03/2011     - replaced "nvpart" in *.AHF_halos files by "fNhires"
(BUIL 316)       measuring the fraction of high-resolution DM particles
                 with respects to all DM particles in a halo
                 -> only functional for GADGET files at the moment...
               - nvpart in *.AHF_profiles is now M_in_r in Msun/h
               - M_gas, and M_star in *.AHF_profiles will be written in Msun/h
               
17/03/2011     - bug fix in rem_unbound() related to WITH_MPI, NEWSTARTRUN, and cur_part->u vs. cur_gas->u
(BUILD 317)

18/03/2011     - added dumping of *.AHF_partcilesSTARDUST files to -DMETALHACK feature
(BUILD 318)      (BE VERY VERY CAREFUL WITH THE IDs: they are currently casted to (int) because of the Fortran reading routines in STARDUST!)

19/03/2011     - went back to fMhires=(M_gas+M_star+M_hiresDM)/(M_total) as a measure for contamination
(BUILD 319)      (Note again, this value is only meaningful for GADGET files at the moment)
               - also decided to dump particle ID's in their native format (i.e. long) into *.AHF_particlesSTARDUST

21/03/2011     - added -DDVIR_200RHOCRIT_VDE that only concerns our VDE simulations
(BUILD 320)

23/03/2011     - restructured the writing of *.AHF_particlesSTARDUST
(BUILD 321)    - bug fix in *.AHF_particlesSTARTDUST -> the age was not in Gyr/h

25/03/2011     - bug fix in reading routines for metals and ages:
(BUILD 322)      the offset calculation for reading metals and ages was
                 wrong when not the complete file was read but only a
                 small part of it.
            
06/04/2011     - added new feature TIPSY_PARTICLE_ORDERING
(BUILD 323)      -> the particle id's are now set according to the position in the TIPSY file keeping the order stars, dark matter, gas
               - added AHF_MINPART_GAS and AHF_MINPART_STARS in src/param.h
                 -> lower limit for calculation of spin and shape based upon gas and star particles only
                 
12/04/2011     - downloaded the latest changes by Steffen from the SVN server
(BUILD 324)

13/04/2011     - added more information about the cosmology to the logfile
(BUILD 325)

14/04/2011     - some minor bug fixes in ahf_gridinfo.c present when compiling with -DAHFDEBUG
(BUILD 326)    - missing #ifdef WITH_MPI in main.c

25/04/2011     - disabled the writing of the redundant *.AHF_substructure files
(BUILD 327)      -> they were causing more trouble than help
               - tuned MergerTree.c to work straight with the standard *.AHF_particles files
               - removed AHF_MASSMIX completely
               
28/04/2011     - added feature WRITE_PARAMETERFILE that writes all the DEFINEFLAGS etc. into a file
(BUILD 328)    - minor bug fixes and cleaning up related to rho_b, rho_crit and rho_vir calculation
                 -> the density profiles will be calculated and written in units of global.rho_vir now,
                    where global.rho_vir is either the background density rho_b or the critical density
                    rho_crit depending on the user's choice (cf. DVIR_200RHOCRIT)
                    
03/05/2011     - added feature AHFdmonly_Rmax_r2 that bases the determination of Rmax and r2 upon DM only
(BUILD 329)      (note that the gas/stars are messing with the rotation curve in the centre...)

05/05/2011     - changed mass unit for TIPSY files to "AHF standard unit"
(BUILD 330)      -> the mass unit is determined by the lightest dark matter particle
                 -> now fMhires will be a reasonable number also for TIPSY!
                 
10/05/2011     - minor bug fixes related to fMhires
(BUILD 331)      -> used abs() instead of fabs(), happens when mixing too many programming languages, sorry :-(
               - made AHFdmonly_Rmax_r2 standard by simply uncommenting it in define.h (not part of STANDARD though!)
               
16/05/2011     - fixed a bug when writing the *.AHF_particles
(BUILD 332)      -> dark matter only simulations did not contain the particle type when compiled with -DPARTICLES_INFO

01/06/2011     - bug fix in ahf_halos_sfc.c that led in very special circumstances
(BUILD 333)      to a return of the last particle (in Hilbert key ordering) multiple
                 times as the first particle in a search box
                 
20/06/2011     - introduction of -DAHFlean, a new specific switch aimed at reducing the memory footprint of AHF.
(BUILD 334)      -> please do get in touch if you want to use it as it collides with several other features!
                    (e.g. we cut the storage for IDs, AHFpotcentre is not working anymore, etc.)
                    
11/07/2011     - Changes related to AHFrestart.  Firstly, the output file name does not
(BUILD 335)      include the rank of the original MPI task anymore, as this never worked
                 at all (and was only printing 0).  And secondly, when using AHFrestart,
                 we don't want to clutter the logfiles and thus don't want VERBOSE to be
                 defined, which currently happens always, when AHFstep is defined.  Now
                 AHFrestart behaves as WITH_MPI (which undefines VERBOSE).

27/07/2011     - bug fix in io_read_gadget.c
(BUILD 336)      -> the blocksize should be 'unsigned int' and not only 'int'
               - added -DDEBUG_STARTRUN in main.c leading to exit() right after startrun()

19/08/2011     - added AHF_NBIN_MULTIPLIER to param.h which can be used
(BUILD 337)      to increase the number of bins used for the profiles

31/08/2011     - fixed an issue with -DAHFptfocus where the particle ID was not kept
(BUILD 338)    - added -DAHFignore_ugas which ignores the gas thermal energy when unbinding

03/09/2011     - bug fix in smooth3()
(BUILD 339)      -> the last bin was not accounted for properly
               - "feature" fix in find_max()
                -> the peak value was determined from the smoothed array and not the original one

06/09/2011     - further bug fix in smooth3()
(BUILD 340)      -> for nbins<3 there was false memory access
               - added proper simu.multimass initialisation to startrun()

13/10/2011     - tuned logfile output a bit (resurrecting memory useage, etc.)
(BUILD 341)    - bug fix in io_deva.c (thanks to Jose Onorbe!)

14/10/2011     - introduced new parameter AHF_HIRES_DM_WEIGHT in param.h facilitating the use of fMhires
(BUILD 342)

17/10/2011     - some more tweaking of logfile
(BUILD 343)    - added command line option "--parameterfile" which will simply dump a file
                 "AHFstep.parameter" containing all (compile/DEFINEFLAG) parameters (usage: "./AHFstep --parameterfile")
                 
04/11/2011     - made -DAHFlean part of STANDARD in define.h
(BUILD 344)    - made -DTEST_NODE part of STANDARD in define.h
               - added -DTEST_CURNODE_ONLY to refine_grid() which only tests the present node for refinement and none of the surrounding ones
                 -> still leads to segmentation faults in ahf_gridinfo.c and hence should not be used yet
                 
08/11/2011     - clearing up a few compile warnings
(BUILD 345)    - fixed issue in output_grid.c and input_grid.c (of no relevance for AHF!)
               - added a few comments about the (im-)possible parallelisation of ahf_gridinfo.c

09/11/2011     - a few bug fixes in libio/io_art.c
(BUILD 346)    - cleaning up sloppy (unsigned in) vs. (int) reading/declarations in libio/io_gadget.c

07/12/2011     - now supporting chunked CubePM format
(BUILD 347)    - includes a bit of clean-up in the CubePM reader
               - removed all references to HAVE_STDINT_H, HAVE_STDBOOL_H and NONC99.
                 AHF now assumes that the user is running a C99 compatible compiler and
                 runtime.  Only very obscure and old systems wouldn't be C99, but you
                 might need to tell the compiler to actually use C99.  This is already
                 done in the Makefile.config_SAMPLE for gcc (-std=c99), though depending
                 on the compiler, it might require a different flag.

                 Note, the Non-C99 compatibility didn't work in AHF for quite a long time,
                 and since no one complained, we can as well clean in up.
                
09/02/2012     - METALHACK improvement: added local_skip_gadget1_blocks() to io_gadget.c
(BUILD 348)      allowing to read AGE and Z blocks in GADGET1 files
                 -> WARNING: this assumes a certain ordering of the blocks, check carefully!
                 
13/02/2012     - added a bit more profiling of AHF into the logfile
(BUILD 349)    - improved header reading in the new routine local_skip_gadget1_blocks()
               - moved '#define AHFlean' from STANDARD to the AHF part in define.h
               - introduced -DAHFdensrecovery switched on by default in define.h
                 -> not using this flag will substantially speed up AHF
                    yet lead to inaccuracies in the density on the edges of refinements
                    (decide for yourself, but my own tests show that the mass function and
                     Vmax function of the Haloes going MAD full box data is not affected!)

14/02/2012     - minor bug fix in local_get_block_id() in io_gadget.c (it returned 'i' instead of 'pread')
(BUILD 350)    - some modifications to define.h properly taking care of AHFdensrecovery
               - forgot to deal with the second unassign_part() call in relink()
               - tweaking and tuning of spatialRef2halos():
                 - some OpenMP parallelisation to spatialRef2halos() switched on via -DWITH_OPENMP3
                 - enclosed some loops setting hostHaloGrids etc. in WITH_AHF_HALOS_SFC ifdef's
               - added -DAHFfast which switches on WITH_OPENMP2 and WITH_OPENMP3 possibly leading to inaccuracies!?
               - added -DAHFpreliminaryhalosfile to write a file with some preliminary halo information at the end of spatialRef2halos()
               - changed from assign_dens() to assign_npart() in gen_refgrid()
               
15/02/2012     - for WITH_AHF_HALOS_SFC spatialRef2halos() does not relink particles to the halos[] anymore
(BUILD 351)      -> this gives a substantial speed-up!
               - tried to implement -DAHFwritehalotype but failed again
                 - what the heck is wrong with the spatialRef[][] tree???
                 - or is the problem in the transferal to the halos[] tree???
                 
15/02/2012     - minor bug fix in first for-loop of spatialRef2halos() introduced in 351
(BUILD 352)

20/02/2012     - minor modifications, e.g. forgot AHFnoHubbleDrag in logfile, placeholder for new gen_amr_hierarchy(), etc.
(BUILD 353)

22/02/2012     - THE SPRING CLEAN HAS STARTED:
(BUILD 354)      * all code related to AMIGA will be removed
                 * only those AHF features considered meaningful will be kept
                    -> this is the first pass as the whole cleaning will be done in small chunks
                       always assuring that AHF will continue to work as advertised...

=============================================================================
****                   finally upgraded AMIGA to AHF                     ****
=============================================================================

24/02/2012     - here we go again...
(BUILD 001)

07/03/2012     - added cNFW to AHF_halos file based upon Eq.(8) of Prada et al. (2012)
(BUILD 002)    - introduced -DAHFaddDMonlyproperties
                  -> all the DM_only.X properties will now only be calculated when this flag is switched on (they are not used at the moment at all!)

07/03/2012     - Xc, Yc, Zc are now output in kpc/h
(BUILD 003)    - no more writing of "a" eigenvalue
               - removed all -DTRACKER instances
               - introduced u_fac=(v_fac)^2 in ahf_halos.c
                 -> when dealing with thermal energies this factor is relevant, but
                    when converting thermal energies to velocities you still require v_fac!

13/03/2012     - fiddled a bit with MergerTree.c
(BUILD 004)    - removed Redge calculation and writing (this value always was a bit dubious)
               - introduced ihost to AHF_halos
               - removed R_edge from AHF_halos (cf. AHFfindRedge)
               - resurrected AHF_substructure
               - removed qsort() from spatialRef2halos() messing up halo-tree (replaced by indexx())
               - changed loops in spatialRef2halos() when determining gatherRad
                 -> now interior loop starts at jj=ii
                 -> added OpenMP pragma 
                 
13/03/2012     - minor improvement in idx_inv()
(BUILD 005)    - removed uneccessary calculation of Rvir2 in spatialRef2halos()
               - removed get_hostHaloID() and get_sublevel()
               - removed hostHaloGrids
               - introduced hostHaloLevel giving the level on which the subhalo spawned from the host
                 -> added both hostHalo and hostHaloLevel to AHF_halos
               - AHF_HOSTHALOLEVEL in param.h controls the first level to be considered as
                 credible to spawn subhaloes and is being used when writing AHF_halos and AHF_substructure
                 
14/03/2012     - final tweaks of AHFsubstructure:
(BUILD 006)      -> added a new for-loop right after the call to ahf_halos_sfc_constructHalo() in ahf_halos.c
                    that checks for "inside virial radius" (as well as MINPART!!!) for those nebulous subhaloes spawned from AHF_HOSTHALOLEVEL
                    (fulle re-hash of halos[].subStruct[] array and halos[].numSubStruct
               - removed hostHaloLevel again from AHF_halos and writing instead numSubStruct
               - introduced AHF_HOSTSUBOVERLAP in param.h measuring the allowed overlap between host and subhalo
               - added halo ID to AHF_halos
               - added surface pressure term to AHF_halos
              
15/03/2012     - TIPSY files now require the input from the user about the thermal energy unit
(BUILD 007)    - the outputfiles are now ordered by M_vir instead of npart
               - removed init_timestep(), init_global_structure(), init_logfile(), init_io_structure(), init_simu_structure()
               - LOADBALANCE_DOMAIN_LEVEL and MAX_GATHER_RAD are now read from AHF.input
               
16/03/2012     - added UseRhoBack and UserDvir to AHF.input
(BUILD 008)

19/03/2012     - Steffen transferred parse_ini.c from GINNUNGAGAP to AHF
(BUILD 009)      -> the AHF.input file now allows the use of sections, comment lines, etc.

20/03/2012     - added some more quantaties to AHF.input (VescTune, LgridMax, NminPerHalo)
(BUILD 010)    - changed all parameter names in AHF.input to something user-friendly
               - added blocks for [ART], [CUBEP3M], and [TIPSY] to AHF.input
                 -> the required code.info file will be written based upon the parameters given in these blocks
               - bug fix in libio/io_xyz.c: f->minpos[] and f->maxpos[] were uninitialized!
               - bug fix in HaloProfiles() and rem_unbound(): I_now was un-initialized for cur_dist-prev_dist==0
               - renamed AQUARIUSfocus to AHFrfocus introducing AHFrfocusX,Y,Z,R in src/param.h
               
30/03/2012     - bug fixes in MPI version
(BUILD 011)      - global_mpi.rank was not known to io_parameter.c
               - AHF_substructure will not be written for the MPI version as the haloID's are not unique!
                 -> further, subhaloes living in the boundary zone will be written on a different CPU
                    and not properly affiliate to the right host as the call to rem_boundary_haloes() comes
                    before the re-hashing of the subhalo information 
                    
02/04/2012     - renamed ahfSats.f to ahfSubCheck.f and adapted it to new AHF_halos format
(BUILD 012)    - moved rem_boundary_haloes() in ahf_halos.c to after re-hashing of substructure information
                 -> this way the MPI version gives the same numSubStruct value as the serial version
                 -> but this requires each MPI task to perform additional work as now also the haloes
                    in the boundary zone will be constructed (though not needed in the end...)
                    
02/04/2012     - changed ordering of the writing of the output files
(BUILD 013)    - minor changed in src/define.h encapsulating AHFpotcentre
               - '--parameterfile' now triggers writing of 'AHF.parameter'
               
05/04/2012     - forgot to adapt all ahfXYZ codes in analysis/, convert/, and tools/ to new format
(BUILD 014)

11/04/2012     - NEW DEFINEFLAG: AHFbinary to ahf_io.c
(BUILD 015)      -> writes AHF_halos, AHF_profiles, and AHF_particles in binary format
                 -> does *not* yet write AHF_substructure or AHF_particlesSTARDUST in binary (files will *not* be written at all!)
                 -> also added read-routines to IDL/util.pro for binary output
                 
19/04/2012     - bug fix in io_tipsy.c (and also in io_gadget.c where it though did not affect anything!)
(BUILD 016)      -> one should only scale the thermal energy for gas particles
                    (for all other particles 'u' stores the type as integer that should obviously not be scaled!)
                    
24/04/2012     - added -DDEBUG_MGADGET providing a bit more info on what's happening when reading multiple gadget files
(BUILD 017)    - NEW DEFINEFLAG: AHFvmbp
                 -> writes velocity of most bound particle into AHF_halos
               - conceptual bug fix: RhoVir and Dvir are now working hand-in-hand, not only for RhoVir=RhoBack!
               - fiddled with calc_virial() to return "virial" in units of either RhoBack or RhoCrit depending on simu.UseRhoBack value
            
04/05/2012     - some minor hacks to facilitate the analysis of non-cosmological simulations
(BUILD 018)

05/05/2012     - NEW DEFINEFLAG: AHFundoPositionShiftAndScale
(BUILD 019)      -> write halo positions in original units as found in input file
                    (only implemented for GADGET, DEVA & TIPSY (not TIPSY_ZOOMDATA!) at the moment!)
                 -> NOTE: this change required to #include "../common.h" to the respective io_CODE.c files!
                 
12/06/2012    - NEW DEFINEFLAG: REFINE_BARYONIC_MASS
(BUILD 020)     -> use mass as refinement criterion for baryons (still number density for dark matter!)
                  -> this might avoid triggering refinements for baryon-only objects which are due to noise!?
              - lots of modifications in MergerTree.c
                -> improved flexibility with input _particles files
                -> removal of obsolete opening of _mtree file for reading
              - halos2geom.c has been adapted to the new _halos file format
              
22/06/2012    - bug fix in rem_unbound(): thermal energy was not in the correct units
(BUILD 021)   - removed simuVweb.c as there is a separate Vweb code now (not part of AHF though)

27/06/2012    - NEW DEFINEFLAG: AHFshellshape
(BUILD 022)     -> base calculation of moment of inertia tensor on particles inside radial shells rather than all particles in sphere
                -> new parameter AHF_MINPART_SHELL in param.h controls min. number of particles for this shell calculation
                   (as it makes no sense to do so for a shell that only contains one or two particles...)

08/07/2012    - valgrind memory leak fixes
(BUILD 023)   - removed some annoying output from the logfile that only bloated the file
              - renamed AHFstep_split_only to AHFsplit_only (NOT tested yet!)
              
16/07/2012    - added TIPSY_, CUBEP3M_, and ART_ info to parameter file
(BUILD 024)

17/07/2012    - resurrected AHFrestart and AHFsplit_only
(BUILD 025)     -> still unsupported features, get in touch for how to use them!
              - bug fix in rem_boundary_halos() affecting MPI and AHFrestart version (bug was introduced in BUILD 023)
                -> we were not supposed to free halos[].ipart and halos[].subStruct for haloes kept!
                
20/07/2012    - added safety feature for AHFrestart that only works together with ic_filetype=5
(BUILD 026)

25/07/2012    - fiddled with Power et al. (2003) convergence criterion for profiles
(BUILD 027)     -> now implemented Eq.(20) instead of Eq.(4)

03/09/2012    - minor fixes in MergerTree.c as compilation failed
(BUILD 028)

05/10/2012    - mainly cosmetic changes here and there:
(BUILD 029)     - added [ART] to AHF.input-example
                - lots of user-interface improvements for simuPk.c
                - bug fix and improvements for AHFpreliminaryhalosfile
                - AHFcentrefile now writes either in STEREO2 or ASCII format
                - added ASCII_ONLYPOSITIONS to read_ascii() in libio_serial/input.c
                
08/10/2012    - some changes in binning_parameter():
(BUILD 030)     - fixed lower limit for nbins to be 2
                - fiddling with loop to determine dist_min (Note, this has minor effects on the very low-mass objects with AHF_MINPART)
              - NEW DEFINEFLAGS:
                -DAHFnewCloseRefDist: + please do *NOT* use this yet, we are tuning closeRefDist in analyseRef() of ahf_halos.c to find subhaloes close to their host's centre
                                      + note, the standard behaviour has been marginally tuned, too!:
                                        -> we are now explicitly checking that only objects more massive will be considered in the closeRefDist calculation (additional condition in if()-clause)
                                        -> we are not calculating a closeRefDist for the direct daughter (i.e. trunk of the halo-tree): gatherRad is the important radius for collecting particles
                -DAHFcentrefileBASIC: + writes a simple _centres files whereas without this flag a fully fletched _halos file for the centres will be written
                
02/11/2012    - NEW DEFINEFLAGS:
(BUILD 031)     -DAHDexciseSubhaloStars (not functional yet, just created infrastructure)
                -DAHFmaxGatherRadTest: debugging and testing, will not form part of any official release
              - bug fix in ahfExtractProfiles.c still reading the old AHF formats

05/11/2012    - bug fix in the calculation of r2 for the combination (AHFdmonly_Rmax_r2 && GAS_PARTICLES)
(BUILD 032)

05/11/2012   - NEW DEFINEFLAG: -DAHFparticle_Rmax_r2
(BUILD 033)    -> based Rmax and r2 calculation on distance sorted particles and *not* a binned profile
               -> NOTE: this flag leads to a substantially slower code (ca. factor 2 for zoom simulations)
               -> NOTE: this flag is switched on by default in src/define.h
               -> NOTE: there is a related parameter in src/param.h controlling how many of the innermost particles to ignore

14/11/2012   - further working on AHFexciseSubhaloStars (not finished yet!)
(BUILD 034)  - bug fix in calc_virial(): wrong re-normalisation of "virial" in case of using the critical density as the reference
             - calc_rho_crit() now always simply returns 3*H(a)^2/(8piG) which will eventually allow easier implementation of dark energy models
             
15/11/2012   - final touches to AHFexciseSubhalosStars (runs through now, but requires some final testing)
(BUILD 035)  - added darkenergy.c/h to libutility.a (by Edoardo Carlesi)

15/11/2012   - NEW DEFINEFLAG: -DDARK_ENERGY  (supplied by Edoardo Carlesi)
(BUILD 036)    -> allows for proper halo edge definitions in all sorts of dark energy models
             - added OpenMP thread info to logfile
             - fixed performance drop accidently introduced into ahf_halos.c in version v1.0-030:
               -> the additional conditions "&& spatialRef[i+1][isoRefIndex].numParts > spatialRef[i+1][isoRefIndexOLD].numParts"
                  in analyseRef() was not affecting the results whatsoever but decreasing the performance by a factor of two!
             - bug fix in binary _halos output file

19/11/2012   - NEW DEFINFEFLAG: -DAHFnewHaloIDs
(BUILD 037)    -> encodes npart and pos[] into a unique ID across MPI tasks
               -> Note that for -DAHFnewHaloIDs the value haloID=0 (and not -1) now corresponds to "field halo" as haloID is an "unsigned long"!
               -> this flag is now *automatically* switched on when using the MPI version (cf. define.h)
               -> you will now also get the AHF_substructure files for the MPI version

04/12/2012   - minor change in check_subhalo() now also only allowing hosts with npart>NminPerHalo
(BUILD 038)

06/12/2012   - some more changes related to the spatialRef[][] and halos[] tree
(BUILD 039)    -> in particular, added an if() in spatialRef2halos() capturing halos with position (0/0/0)

10/12/1012   - adjustment of IORD in interpolate() in libutility/general.c
(BUILD 040)  - now also counting the number of spatialRef[][] with numParts=0
             - added   "if(halo->npart == 0) return;"  to ahf_halos_sfc_constructHalo()
             
08/01/2013   - bug fix for -DAHFexciseSubhaloStars
(BUILD 041)    -> nsubstar=0 was not handled correctly
             - Makefile.config did not contain -DWITH_OPENMP for Standard MPI+OpenMP target
             
08/01/2013   - totnumIsoRef, numHalos, and final halo count in spatialRef2halos() did not match
(BUILD 042)    -> added -DREVISED_INITIAL_NUMHALOS to spatialRef2halos() rectifying this (switched on by default!)

09/01/2013   - NEW DEFINEFLAG: -DAHFdisks
(BUILD 043)    -> writes a new output file *.AHF_disks that will contain profile information for the gas and stars
                  to be used to determine the central baryonic objects (e.g. disk)
             - WITH_MPI still did not write _substructure even though AHFnewHaloIDs had been switched on
               -> fixed now!
               -> ACTUALLY, this requires *A LOT* of fixes! Haloes in the boundary zone were no longer accessible for
                  writing to .AHF_substructure and hence the whole treatment of those boundary haloes has changed
                  -> they are now *NOT* removed anymore but only flagged using flag_boundary_halos(); all write routines now check for this flag...
                     this brings another memory advantage as rem_boundary_halos() temporarily required twice the memory for haloes
               -> ALSO CHANGED OUTPUT FORMAT FOR *.AHF_SUBSTRUCTRE FILES: DROPPED THE LEADING NHALOS INTEGER!
             - bug fix: getHaloID() in specific.c had a bug as it was using Xpos twice instead of Xpos and Ypos
             - removed -DREVISED_INITIAL_NUMHALOS as a feature and made it the one-and-only code
             
10/01/2013   - some fixes for debugging information (of no relevance to the end-user)
(BUILD 044)    -> AHFgridinfofile now uses the proper outfile_prefix, etc.
             - added debugging error message to io_mgadget.c
             
14/01/2013   - added infrastructure for libtree.a
(BUILD 045)  - added more debugging messages for -DDEBUG_SUPERMUC

15/01/2013   - NEW DEFINEFLAG: -DMGADGET_CHECK_RLIMIT_NOFILE
(BUILD 046)    -> file descriptor checks to io_mgadget_open() in io_mgadget.c

16/01/2013   - NEW DEFINEFLAG -DMGADGET_OPENCLOSE: 
(BUILD 047)    -> allowing for "open-single/read-single/close-single" structure when dealing with multiple GAGDET files (as opposed to "open-all/read-all/close-all")

17/01/2013   - renamed
(BUILD 048)    * -DMGADGET_CHECK_RLIMIT_NOFILE to -DCHECK_RLIMIT_NOFILE and
               * -DMGADGET_OPENCLOSE           to -DFOPENCLOSE
               -> this is more general and will also be used then for all other file formats
             - -DFOPENCLOSE is by default switched on now in src/define.h (therefore had to add "../define.h" to some of the libio/ sources)
             - removed fname[] from io_mgadget_t structure again -> redundant information as the name is already stored in io_gadget_t structure
             
18/01/2013   - implementing the final touches suggested by Steffen
(BUILD 049)

28/01/2013   - moved safety feature for TIPSY files from io_tipsy_readpart_raw() to io_tipsy_open()
(BUILD 050)

28/01/2013   - NEW DEFINFLAG: NCPUREADING_EQ_NFILES
(BUILD 051)    -> speads up I/O of multiple (GADGET) files in MPI mode,
                  but only works if NcpuReading is equal to the number of files
             - removed various DEBUG_NREAD and DEBUG_SUPERMUC defines
             
29/01/2013   - bug fix for AHFdisks: b_star and c_star was not set correctly
(BUILD 052)  - bug fix in io_gadget.c introduced while (not properly) cleaing all those DEBUG_SUPERMUC defines
             - added simuCroCo.c to analysis/

             - NEW DEFINEFLAG -DBCASTHEADER
               -> only one MPI taks will read the header and broadcast all relevant information across MPI_COMM_WORLD
               
11/02/2013   - some more tweaking of -DBCASTHEADER
(BUIL 054)     -> io_util_findfiles() is now only called by one MPI task and information Bcast afterwards

12/02/2013   - NEW DEFINEFLAG: -DCUBEP3M_WITH_PIDS
(BUILD 055)    -> quick-and-dirty way of allowing CubeP3M files to also contain particle ids
             - adding binary2ascii.c to convert/
               -> this required some minor modifications in ahf_io.c, too (e.g. ahf_binwrite_particles() did not write uint64_t for the ids!)
               -> further, the binary format now contains the integer "1" at the beginning of the file to quickly figure out the need for a byteswap
               
14/02/2013   - made AHFbinary2ascii.c more modular allowing users to easier filter halo and profile properties
(BUILD 056)  - NEW DEFINEFLAG: -DSUSSING2013 activating output formats for "Sussing Merger Trees 2013"

(BUILD 057)    -> in io_mgadget_init() f->multimass and f->no_part were not broadcast

22/02/2013   - change of output format for _particles:
(BUILD 058)    -> next to the number of particles in a halo also the haloID features
               -> adjusted MergerTree.c accordingly
             - NEW DEFINEFLAGS: -DAHFmixHaloIDandSnapID
               -> construct a haloid that combines the actual haloid and the snapshotid
                  (requires one additional AHF.input parameter "SnapID")
             - removed unneccesary initialisations in alloc_struct()

28/02/2013   - fiddling with -DAHFdisks feature

05/03/2013   - GAS_PARTICLES fprintf() to parameterfile was missing in specific.c
(BUILD 060)

(BUILD 062)  - major modifications to MergerTree.c
               -> adding MTREE_BOTH_WAYS which will not allow multiple descendants, i.e. progenitors are now unique!
             - major change to binning_parameters() in specific.c:
               -> for dist_min we are now searching for the innermost particle with dist != 0
               
09/04/2013   - bug fix for star particles:
(BUILD 063)    -> sometimes we identified them via if(cur_part->u==PSTAR) and sometimes via if(fabs(cur_part->u-PSTAR)<ZERO)
                  (removed the former now!)

09/04/2013   - some fiddling with all those ZERO's in src/param.h
(BUILD 064)     -> setting MACHINE_ZERO uniquely to 5e-16
                -> changing comparisons to an actual '0' within the code to *not* compare against ZERO anymore but MACHINE_ZERO
                   (ZERO is to be understood as a float-comparison accuracy level)
             - fixed a free() issue in MergerTree.c
             
15/05/2013   - fine-tuning of -DAHFpreliminaryhalosfile

             - addition of sigmaH.c to analysis/

22/05/2013   - bug fix for -DAHFexciseSubhaloStars
(BUILD 066)    -> when a halo did not contain subhaloes, the stars were not copied over to the array ipart_uniquestars[] and hence not written to _particlesSTARDUSTexcised

06/06/2013   - renamed AHFpreliminaryhalosfile feature to DPhalos
(BUILD 067)  - adapted DPhalos to also work WITH_MPI
             - added several features to sigmaH.c
             
26/06/2013   - adding haloID (next to npart_stars) to STARDUSTparticles files
(BUILD 068)  - bug fix in io_artnew.c

07/07/2013   - io_artnew.c introduced problem leading to non-compilation issue for practically all codes
(BUILD 069)    -> fixed now!

12/09/2013   - bug fixes in io_tipsy.c (only affecting the MPI version)
(BUILD 070)  - "bug" fix when using fseek()
               -> fseek() can only deal with <2GB files, use fseeko() (-DFSEEKO) when files are larger
               -> presently fix only implemented for TIPSY file format though!
               
19/09/2013   - bug fix in io_parameter.c related to IO_FILE_MCUBEP3M files

(BUILD 072)    -> instead of half-distance it is now 3/4 distance
             - bug fix in MergerTree.c
               -> PidMax[] had to be a two-valued array
             - added NCPUREADING_EQ_FILES to io_mgadget_open() in io_mgadget.c:
               -> now each MPI task will read its own file also incl. the header
               -> NCPUREADING_EQ_NFILES is now mutually exclusive with BCASTHEADER! DO NOT USE THEM TOGETHER!!!!!!
               -> copy a copy of the previous io_mgadget_open() routine to io_mgadget_open_withoutNCPUREADING_EQ_NFILES(), just in case!
               
14/11/2013   - added MergerTreeMPI.c to analysis/
(BUILD 073)  - added MergerRates.c to analysis/ (not functional yet!)

25/11/2013   - bug fix: for -DAHFcomcentre there was an issue with periodic boundary conditions leading to haloes being discarded
(BUILD 074)  - bug fix in MergerTree.c: the actual haloids were not used for the *_idx files
             - added -DAHFspatialReffile
             - DPhalos file is now written in kpc/h
             
26/11/2013   - adjustment to calc_virial(), i.e. removing a^3 factor in eta
(BUILD 075)    -> convergence to SCDM value of 178 at high redshift is NOW guaranteed

(BUILD 076)

18/02/2014   - added angular momentum to ahfSubhaloAccretion.c
(BUILD 077)  - playing with MergerRates.c
             - adding I/O for multiple _particles files to MergerTree.c (compile-flag!)
             - added -DAHOBBS_GADGET_FILE_FIX to io_gadget.c (do not even think about using this, unless you know exactly what this means!)
             
10/03/2014   - in light of the imminent AHF2 there had to be some additions to specific.c coded
(BUILD 078)  - ASCII format (ic_filetype=10) now requires redshifts instead of expansion factors
             - final touches to MergerRates.c
             - fixed typo in ahfHaloHistory.c

08/04/2014   - minor bug fix in ahfSubhaloAccretion.c: bcompare() function was the wrong way round (twice, and hence actually worked)
(BUILD 080)  - added ahfCheckSubhalos.c to tools/

09/04/2014   - working on bug fix for numSubStruct != numSubPointers
(BUILD 081)    -> replaced for-loop in ahf_halos() that copies SubStruct[] over to halos[] by a simple memory re-assignment
               -> moved flagging of MPI boundary haloes to before re-hashing of substructure information
             - added ahfCalcHaloID.c to tools/
             - full update for libtree/ incl. all the code written by Fernando Campos now!
             
25/04/2014   - new treatment for TIPSY position units
(BUILD 082)    -> positions are now scaled using (pos_max-pos_min) instead of TIPSY_BOXSIZE

28/04/2014   - bug fix in io_tipsy.c:
(BUILD 083)    -> division by boxsize should only take place if particle positions demand it
             - added libahf2/
               -> no new version number yet as we are still far from release date...
             - bug fix in spatialRef2halos():
               -> if(count<numHalos) at the end was only checked for #ifdef VERBOSE
               -> now encapsulated in #ifdef AHFadjust_numHalos_to_count
               
16/05/2014   - bug fix in io_gadget.c
(BUILD 084)    -> an if() was checking for "weight" whereas it should have checked for "u"
                  (no results were affected as the if() was also what it was supposed to be!)
             - bug fix in libio_serial's input.c
               -> particle types in read_gadget() were not correctly set
             - added simu2tipsy.c to convert/ which uses libio_serial to write TIPSY binaries for all formats supported by libio_serial
             - renamed ahfCheckSubhalos.c to ahfCheckHaloIDs.c
             - changes to spatialRef2halos():
               - adjusted first estimate of numHalos in spatialRef2halos() to not count main branches twice
               - halo centres will now always be re-adjusted on every level (not only on the last one)
               - removed #ifdef AHFadjust_numHalos_to_count => count is now checked against numHalos
