Here we simply placed the original files of MergerTree.c, MergerTreeMPI.c, and MergerRates.c.

MergerTree.c (as of 24/02/2024) served as the base for "the detachment from AHF".

MergerTreeMPI.c was originally written by Edoardo Carlesi and has not been maintained or updated since he finished his PhD in 2014). It might serve as the starting point for a new parallelisation, but at the moment it is not recommended to use it.

MergerRates.c also required substantial logistical changes to become detached from AHF.
