Hdf2GADGET

This small program converts GADGET simulation output Hdf5 files to fortran
binary files (new format). Currently it reads the following parameters from the
header (in Hdf5 notation; the naming conventions can be found in the GADGET
manual written by Volker Springel):

NumPart_ThisFile, MassTable, Time, Redshift, Flag_Sfr, Flag_Feedback,
NumPart_Total, Flag_Cooling, NumFilesPerSnapshot, BoxSize, Omega0, OmegaLambda,
HubbleParam, Flag_StellarAge, Flag_Metals, NumPart_Total_HighWord

And these data blocks:
Coordinates, Velocity, Mass, ParticleIDs, InternalEnergy


 
Calling sequence:
Hdf2GADGET.f90 -> Hdf2GADGET_subroutines.f90 -> Hdf2GADGET_io.f90

Hdf2GADGET.f90 is the main program, which calls the subroutine get_gadget_file
from Hdf2GADGET_subroutines.f90 for each file, then writes the data into the
binary files. get_gadget_file is essentially a subroutine to read Hdf5 gadget
files, and can be adapted easily for any purpose.

Hdf2GADGET.f90 requires as input a parameter file called
Hdf2GADGET_param_file.dat; This file is made up of only three lines:

1. The directory in which the snapshot to be read is located. This is read into
a character variable, and so should be surrounded by single quote marks. For
example:
'/data/snapshot/'
2. The number of the snapshot to be read. a simple integer.
3. The location you wish the output files to be written to. For example:
'/data/output/'

The output files will be named according to the GADGET2 convention, i.e.:
snapshot_XXX.Y

The program is compiled using the Makefile.
IMPORTANT:
The makefile requires the location of the compiler and the Hdf5 libraries. By
default these are found in a file called make.COSMA4, and need to be changed for
every machine the program is run on.
